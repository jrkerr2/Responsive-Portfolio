# Responsive-Portfolio
HW w2-2

- This homework submission seems incomplete. I'm uncertain because I'm not clear on the requirements and the screenshots don't help me much.

- I think I've added the skeleton of what I need for media queries (css) and viewport settings (html), but I really haven't added any custom responsiveness. The pages are responsive only in that they do what they do "out of the box". I will endeavor to engage a TA before Saturday's class and adjust as best I can, but if you're reading this and the responsiveness is not meeting expectations, now you know why.

- Overall, I think it would be helpful to me (and likely others, too) to have a class review after each week's homework to review the solution and ask questions on what we might have missed and why our solution was not optimal (for whatever reason).

- To that end, I'm going to use the remaining time between now and class to glean some understanding of the recommended portfolio css solution from last week to see if I can improve my bootstrap-only version (and also to make sure I understand the TA-shared css version).
